At the point when individual consider buying a car there are many aspects that could impact his or her choice which kind of car she is interested in. Buying a car is a tedious job, many factors must be considered before buying a car. The study here aims to identify what are the important factors are available for considering in buying a car. Supervised Classification is used to obtain accurate results for the prediction of the Car Acceptability using buying, maintainace, lug_ boot, doors, Person and safety to be the predictors for the response variable Car Acceptability. Best Subset Selection is used for feature selection and used these predictors for Logistic Regression to obtain highly accurate results was the approach for fitting the model followed by cross validation technique. The model consisting of all the six predictors i.e. buying, maintainace, lug_boot, doors, Person and safety for predicting the Acceptability of the car.
